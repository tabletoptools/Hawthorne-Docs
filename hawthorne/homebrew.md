## Cooldown Cigar
**Wondrous Item, Very Rare**  
*T1, 300GP*

This cigar is marked with a mystical rune that was enchanted by an ancient bard. When smoked, it gives off luxurious fumes that seem to rejuvenate your body on a deep, physical level.

## Conductor's Baton
**Wondrous Item, Rare (requires attunement by a bard)**  
*T2, 1200GP*

This small, wooden stick is 12" long and tapers slightly towards the tip. At the other end it widens to a small bulb sufficient to counterbalance the shaft. Once attuned by a bard, as an action, the baton can be used to cast Silence and Enthrall. Once the instrument has been used to cast these spells, it can’t be used to cast them again until the next dawn. Additionally, if you spend one minute conducting the motions of a song, the baton can be used to make a number of mundane musical instruments you can see equal to twice your bard level, start playing themselves. This effect requires concentration and the effect ends if concentration is broken.

## Dusty Conch Shell
**Wondrous Item, Rare**
*T2, 700GP*
Blowing this shell will magically summon a dust mephit, who will rise out of the nearest patch of exposed earth. If there is no exposed earth within sight of the blower, it will not be summoned.
It will remain while the blower concentrates (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute or until he is killed. It then returns to its home – if it is killed, it cannot be summoned again. 

While summoned, it is friendly to the blower and his companions. The mephit does not like combat, but will fight if asked. After it departs, it can't be summoned again for a full day. If it was involved in combat, it can’t be summoned again for a full tenday.
